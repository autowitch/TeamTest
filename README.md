TeamTest
========

Currently teamtest is a simple test runner. Configure a project with a basepath, TeamTest will poll/watch the directory and run any associated tests you've created.

A green tab means your test passed! An orange means it failed. Click on the test tabs to see the output of each test.

Version 2.0 will be a way to gameify testing, by allowing points based on various activities.
